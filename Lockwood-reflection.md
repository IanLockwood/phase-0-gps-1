# GPS 1.1 Reflection

- What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I wasn't certain what pull and merge did, and why. I also didn't understand how to resolve merge conflicts.

- What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

All of those! I now totally understand pull and merge, and it turns out resolving merge conflicts is pretty easy. I also clarified the usefulness of branching.

- What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

We mostly just asked for clarification on things (like pull and merge) and checked in about whether we were following the workflow correctly. We also asked a little bit about DBC culture, like office hours and lateness.

- What still confuses you about git?

Actually, pretty much nothing of what we've covered so far. But I know there's more, and I know things are going to get more complicated when I'm working collaboratively with large groups.

- How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

Positive! My partner was nice and my guide was very helpful. I was a little bit tense because a knowledgeable person was observing me, but I'm sure that will fade.
